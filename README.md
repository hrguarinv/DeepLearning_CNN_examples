# Deep Learning Image Classification Examples

## Overview
This repository contains simple examples demonstrating the application of deep learning to both binary and multiple image classification tasks. The examples are implemented using Jupyter notebooks. Please note that content of the Jupyter notebook is in Portuguese. 

## Project Structure
- `cats-vs-dogs-binaryclassify-dl.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for binary classification using images of cats and dogs.
- `house-data-multiclassify-dl.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for multiple classification involving images of household objects.

## Features
- Augmentation of images to increase dataset size and diversity.
- Training of deep learning models using the provided datasets.
- Evaluation of model performance using various metrics.

## Getting Started
To run the examples, follow these steps:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the desired Jupyter notebook (`cats-vs-dogs-binaryclassify-dl.ipynb` or `house-data-multiclassify-dl.ipynb`) in your Jupyter environment.
3. Follow the instructions within the notebook to execute the code cells and explore the examples.

## Dependencies
The examples require the following dependencies:
- Python 3
- Jupyter Notebook
- Deep Learning Framework (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch)
- Image Processing Libraries (e.g., OpenCV, PIL)
- Pandas
- Numpy

Install the necessary dependencies using pip:
```bash
pip install jupyterlab tensorflow opencv-python...
